This is the place where DeepLearning Projects are done <br/>
--Purpose: Compare 2 models done for CIFAR10 <br/>
-- Model A: Basic CNN model done in TensorFlow (TF) <br/>
-- Model B: Basic model done using ResNet blocks in TF <br/>
<br/>
Both models's activation maps and heatmaps are retreived to see the issues of low accuracy rate for Cats category  <br/>
Warning : This is certainly not the best solution or production worthy - but take it as a earnest student who is picking things up on a learning journey! <br/>

This is the place where DeepLearning Projects are done
--Purpose: Compare 2 models done for CIFAR10 
-- Model A: Basic CNN model done in TensorFlow (TF)
-- Model B: Basic model done using ResNet blocks in TF

Both models's activation maps and heatmaps are retreived to see the issues of low accuracy rate for Cats category

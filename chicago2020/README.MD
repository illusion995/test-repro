This is a notebook that takes a look at Chicago Crime Rate, using Pandas and seaborn for visualization.
The download link for the data is at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-2001-to-present-398a4

Note that the file is pretty big (1.6GB) so you will need to be patient 

As the intent is for me to brush up my own skills in pandas, I've taken to borrowing interesting questions from others' work (see the notebook references which I've credited those people for their work). As a part of a learning journey, I'm always grateful for various public sites and github where people have
shared their ideas and tools
